### Familiar with Mozilla's work
Mozilla has made their [code](https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug) public. [testselect](https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/blob/master/bugbug/models/testselect.py) aligns with our project best.

[rust-code-analysis](https://github.com/mozilla/rust-code-analysis) can be used to calculate metrics from code/patches.

Now, [data mining](https://github.com/baolef/libreoffice-ci/blob/data/dataset/mining.py) is finished. It is able to generate raw features from commits.
