### Commit feature extraction

[Commit feature extraction](https://github.com/baolef/libreoffice-ci/blob/data/dataset/mining.py) is finished with multiprocessing. The commits come from the csv table. Features are based on the patch (what changes in the commit), code features, author features and so on. The output is saved in `data/commits.gz`.

### Unit test feature extraction

[Unit test feature extraction](https://github.com/baolef/libreoffice-ci/blob/data/dataset/test_history.py) is finished with single thread. It computes features of unit tests from `data/commits.gz`.
