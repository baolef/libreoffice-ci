### Model training

Basic [model training](https://github.com/baolef/libreoffice-ci/blob/main/train.py) pipeline is completed with [testselect](https://github.com/baolef/libreoffice-ci/blob/main/models/testselect.py) model. Further optimization is needed to reduce memory and time cost, together with performance.

Currently, [testselect](https://github.com/baolef/libreoffice-ci/blob/main/models/testselect.py) is trained on a subset of the full dataset, and it has reached the following performance:
