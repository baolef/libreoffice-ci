### Jenkins integration

Currently, the model is integrated into [Jenkins](https://ci.libreoffice.org/job/machine_learning_model/). The average build duration is around 15s, and it is able to support 5 builds in parallel.

Its [output log](https://ci.libreoffice.org/job/machine_learning_model/lastBuild/console) mainly contains the probability of a patch to fail a unit test and its overall probability to fail any test.

Further work will be done to better integrate the model into Jenkins.
