### Result archive

Every time Jenkins runs the model, the inference results will be saved to `probability.csv`, which is archived by Jenkins.

### Jenkins integration

The model is integrated into a [master job](https://ci.libreoffice.org/job/gerrit_master_ml/). In this job, the model will first be run to decide whether the commit is likely to fail. If it is, then run [gerrit_linux_clang_dbgutil](https://ci.libreoffice.org/job/gerrit_linux_clang_dbgutil/) first. If it fails, then return -1, else run the rest builds. If the model predicts that the commit is unlikely to fail, then run all the build in parallel like before.
